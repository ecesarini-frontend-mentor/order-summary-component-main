## My process

Tried to follow design example. Added **hover action** purpose of the challenge. Added also responsive actions using _@media query_

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm quite noob on _front-end design_. This challenge helped me focusing on main CSS-HTML best practice when you try to get a good web page.
Learned few things about managing dimensions, inherity and flexboxes.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
